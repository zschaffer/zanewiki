          So, I got a chromebook. I'm genuinly very impressed with the
          programming potential of these litte, cheap things. For about 300
          dollars, I've got a device that can run multiple gitpod instances,
          watch some youtube videos, talk to coworkers and friends, and run nvim
          in a browser tab. There are things on here I never knew I would want
          to have, and it feels like every day I find a new quirk to explore. I
          guess I've become chromepilled and am now just waiting for the rest of
          the world to do literally everything within the domain of a browser
          window ( not very open-source of me I guess ).

          Welp, both Xinrui and I are terribly sick. Went in for a covid-19 test
          today to see if we could rule that out - but I'm honestly not sure
          what this could be. I'll spare you from the list of symptoms but it
          has been a very tough couple of days.

          In other news, I've been messing around with alternative keyboard
          layouts again. Workman and Colemak are the two I always come back to,
          always unfruitful in my efforts to unlock a secret super efficient new
          workflow. Yet the practice of trying to unlearn QWERTY tickles my
          brain in a very nice way that keeps me coming back every couple years.

          Just got my first 'espresso machine' in the mail today. A Flair NEO.
          I'm no espresso expert by any means, but this robot looking lever
          contraption can make a damn good espresso considering I'm lacking on a
          lot of other 'ingredients' such as a $500 grinder and 0.001g tuned
          Acacia scale.

          Currently typing this from inside a warehouse-feeling brewery in
          Capitol Hill. Drinking a ridiculously smooth red ale while scouring
          meetup.com for new avenues to meet friends with Xinrui. There's a
          lovely little taco truck outside pedalling hot pork but might need a
          slice of pizza after all this to settle the stomach. See you next time
          : )

          I have a glass of wine, and my trusty kindle by my side, with nothing
          much to talk about on here. I'm still doing mostly the same things (
          learning rust, working on code generators for my 9-5, trying to stay
          fit, and building the most over-engineered homelab possible on my
          budget ). Xinrui can finally walk again so we took a stroll through
          Costco for our re-up on rotisserie chicken, protein bars, and a failed
          attempt at finding group pork for homemade dumplings.

          Our home is now very blue, even though not many things have been
          painted this color - everything else is so drab that our room mostly
          looks blue. Our coffee table / media center has this stickiness ( due
          to the latex in the paints glossy finish ) that I sort of admire for
          its strength, firmly securing my cup to the table at all times.

          I got a new computer - did a massive amount of distro hopping from
          antix to fedora silverblue. I've settled on Pop OS for now as it's
          simple and 'Just Works' while letting me customize it to feel like
          home. Beyond that, I've been doing good - just working on projects and
          continuing to further my knowledge of the rust language.

          Xinrui's ankle is still slowly healing but I'm hoping we can go do
          something outside in February. As things are getting warmer and the
          sunsets are getting more intense, nature has started to call me. Till
          next time ~

          Everyone I know is getting COVID-19 so I imagine i'll be spending
          quite a lot of time at home again. Time to advance my learning of
          tricky javascript concepts + continue my journey learning rustlang ~

          I recently ordered some new switches for my keyboard and will be doing
          my first ever 'lubing' of said switches and stabilizers. Hoping I
          don't make a mess but looking forward to the supposed meditative
          effect of the whole process.

          Don't have much to share this time - just felt like writing and
          putting up this new picture. I finally have my new desktop running
          linux ("<a href="https://endeavouros.com">Endeavour OS btw</a>") setup
          and customized to my likings. I'd like to thank everyone over at
          <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn">r/unixporn</a> for the
          dotfiles and pure aesthetics.

          I guess the photo for todays post should thematically be my new
          desktop setup but... I just got my dropbox all working again and found
          some old art stuff I made a year or two ago. This little rock cluster
          blurbily thing is one of those art pieces! I ran it through the
          standard `lid -m r` and thought it came out pretttttty good. Anyways -
          have a lovely rest of your year and see you in 2022 ~

          Hi again! <em>~ Merry Christmas ~</em> if you celebrate such things.
          It almost snowed today in Seattle, which would've been the first time
          I've seen snowy earth since I lived in New York - aswell as the first
          time <a href="https://xinrui.work">Xinrui</a> has gotten to experience
          real snow. Alas - the elements didn't line up and all we got was wet
          mush melting away within 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hoping that the
          <a
            href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/ahead-of-lowest-temperatures-in-a-decade-seattle-officials-urge-preparation/">'Record
            Breaking'</a>
          cold temperatures in the next few days might bring some actual powder
          to the Emerald City.

          <em>Hello!</em> Welcome to my home away from home. Incase you're new
          here - I update this section every now and then with some recent
          life-news. I recently moved back to my home state of
          <a href="https://wikipedia.com/wiki/washington_(state)">Washington</a>. It's nice to be back in Seattle,
          surrounded by trees and drizzling
          clouds.
