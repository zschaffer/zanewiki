            Don't have much to share this time - just felt like writing and
            putting up this new picture. I finally have my new desktop running
            linux ("<a href="https://endeavouros.com">Endeavour OS btw</a>") setup
            and customized to my likings. I'd like to thank everyone over at
            <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn">r/unixporn</a> for the
            dotfiles and pure aesthetics.

            I guess the photo for todays post should thematically be my new
            desktop setup but... I just got my dropbox all working again and found
            some old art stuff I made a year or two ago. This little rock cluster
            blurbily thing is one of those art pieces! I ran it through the
            standard `lid -m r` and thought it came out pretttttty good. Anyways -
            have a lovely rest of your year and see you in 2022 ~

          Hi again! <em>~ Merry Christmas ~</em> if you celebrate such things.
          It almost snowed today in Seattle, which would've been the first time
          I've seen snowy earth since I lived in New York - aswell as the first
          time <a href="https://xinrui.work">Xinrui</a> has gotten to experience
          real snow. Alas - the elements didn't line up and all we got was wet
          mush melting away within 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hoping that the

          cold temperatures in the next few days might bring some actual powder
          to the Emerald City.

        <em>Hello!</em> Welcome to my home away from home. Incase you're new
        here - I update this section every now and then with some recent
        life-news. I recently moved back to my home state of
        <a href="https://wikipedia.com/wiki/washington_(state)">Washington</a
        >. It's nice to be back in Seattle, surrounded by trees and drizzling
        clouds.
