          Hi again! <em>~ Merry Christmas ~</em> if you celebrate such things.
          It almost snowed today in Seattle, which would've been the first time
          I've seen snowy earth since I lived in New York - aswell as the first
          time <a href="https://xinrui.work">Xinrui</a> has gotten to experience
          real snow. Alas - the elements didn't line up and all we got was wet
          mush melting away within 10 minutes.

        <em>Hello!</em> Welcome to my home away from home. Incase you're new
        here - I update this section every now and then with some recent
        life-news. I recently moved back to my home state of
        <a href="https://wikipedia.com/wiki/washington_(state)">Washington</a
        >. It's nice to be back in Seattle, surrounded by trees and drizzling
        clouds.
