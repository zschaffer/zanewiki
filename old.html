            I have a glass of wine, and my trusty kindle by my side, with nothing
            much to talk about on here. I'm still doing mostly the same things (
            learning rust, working on code generators for my 9-5, trying to stay
            fit, and building the most over-engineered homelab possible on my
            budget ). Xinrui can finally walk again so we took a stroll through
            Costco for our re-up on rotisserie chicken, protein bars, and a failed
            attempt at finding group pork for homemade dumplings.

            Our home is now very blue, even though not many things have been
            painted this color - everything else is so drab that our room mostly
            looks blue. Our coffee table / media center has this stickiness ( due
            to the latex in the paints glossy finish ) that I sort of admire for
            its strength, firmly securing my cup to the table at all times.

            I got a new computer - did a massive amount of distro hopping from
            antix to fedora silverblue. I've settled on Pop OS for now as it's
            simple and 'Just Works' while letting me customize it to feel like
            home. Beyond that, I've been doing good - just working on projects and
            continuing to further my knowledge of the rust language.

            Xinrui's ankle is still slowly healing but I'm hoping we can go do
            something outside in February. As things are getting warmer and the
            sunsets are getting more intense, nature has started to call me. Till
            next time ~

            Everyone I know is getting COVID-19 so I imagine i'll be spending
            quite a lot of time at home again. Time to advance my learning of
            tricky javascript concepts + continue my journey learning rustlang ~

            I recently ordered some new switches for my keyboard and will be doing
            my first ever 'lubing' of said switches and stabilizers. Hoping I
            don't make a mess but looking forward to the supposed meditative
            effect of the whole process.

            Don't have much to share this time - just felt like writing and
            putting up this new picture. I finally have my new desktop running
            linux ("<a href="https://endeavouros.com">Endeavour OS btw</a>") setup
            and customized to my likings. I'd like to thank everyone over at
            <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn">r/unixporn</a> for the
            dotfiles and pure aesthetics.

            I guess the photo for todays post should thematically be my new
            desktop setup but... I just got my dropbox all working again and found
            some old art stuff I made a year or two ago. This little rock cluster
            blurbily thing is one of those art pieces! I ran it through the
            standard `lid -m r` and thought it came out pretttttty good. Anyways -
            have a lovely rest of your year and see you in 2022 ~

          Hi again! <em>~ Merry Christmas ~</em> if you celebrate such things.
          It almost snowed today in Seattle, which would've been the first time
          I've seen snowy earth since I lived in New York - aswell as the first
          time <a href="https://xinrui.work">Xinrui</a> has gotten to experience
          real snow. Alas - the elements didn't line up and all we got was wet
          mush melting away within 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hoping that the
          <a

          >
          cold temperatures in the next few days might bring some actual powder
          to the Emerald City.

        <em>Hello!</em> Welcome to my home away from home. Incase you're new
        here - I update this section every now and then with some recent
        life-news. I recently moved back to my home state of
        <a href="https://wikipedia.com/wiki/washington_(state)">Washington</a
        >. It's nice to be back in Seattle, surrounded by trees and drizzling
        clouds.
