          I have a glass of wine, and my trusty kindle by my side, with nothing
          much to talk about on here. I'm still doing mostly the same things (
          learning rust, working on code generators for my 9-5, trying to stay
          fit, and building the most over-engineered homelab possible on my
          budget ). Xinrui can finally walk again so we took a stroll through
          Costco for our re-up on rotisserie chicken, protein bars, and a failed
          attempt at finding group pork for homemade dumplings.

          Our home is now very blue, even though not many things have been
          painted this color - everything else is so drab that our room mostly
          looks blue. Our coffee table / media center has this stickiness ( due
          to the latex in the paints glossy finish ) that I sort of admire for
          its strength, firmly securing my cup to the table at all times.
