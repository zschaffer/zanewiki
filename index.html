          I got a new computer - did a massive amount of distro hopping from
          antix to fedora silverblue. I've settled on Pop OS for now as it's
          simple and 'Just Works' while letting me customize it to feel like
          home. Beyond that, I've been doing good - just working on projects and
          continuing to further my knowledge of the rust language.

          Xinrui's ankle is still slowly healing but I'm hoping we can go do
          something outside in February. As things are getting warmer and the
          sunsets are getting more intense, nature has started to call me. Till
          next time ~
