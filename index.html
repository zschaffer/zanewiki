          Well I guess I'm a 'biker' now... I found an amazing little community
          driven bike kitchen near my house. They let you come in and use their
          tools and stands to work on your bike, providing guidence when lost.
          Really makes the whole experience of working on your bike feel
          communal and guided.

          In other news, I've submitted to the realm of frontend programming..
          Gone are my days of building useless CLI's in Go, trudging through the
          Rust Book, and general tomfoolery. Now I'm trying to perfect my React
          architecture and be efficient with my api calls. It's not my favorite
          thing in the world but I'm starting to like it a lot more.

          I've gotten quite lazy at both updating this site and finding new
          images - I do really like the current one below, so I shall keep that
          and continue enabling my laziness as long as I please.
