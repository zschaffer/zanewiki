          Don't have much to share this time - just felt like writing and
          putting up this new picture. I finally have my new desktop running
          linux ("<a href="https://endeavouros.com">Endeavour OS btw</a>") setup
          and customized to my likings. I'd like to thank everyone over at
          <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn">r/unixporn</a> for the
          dotfiles and pure aesthetics.

          I guess the photo for todays post should thematically be my new
          desktop setup but... I just got my dropbox all working again and found
          some old art stuff I made a year or two ago. This little rock cluster
          blurbily thing is one of those art pieces! I ran it through the
          standard `lid -m r` and thought it came out pretttttty good. Anyways -
          have a lovely rest of your year and see you in 2022 ~
