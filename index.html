          The snow has started to compact and freeze --- I wonder when it'll
          finally melt. I think this might be the most snow I've seen in
          Seattle, only comparable to the big snow storm while I was a kid.

          Everyone I know is getting COVID-19 so I imagine i'll be spending
          quite a lot of time at home again. Time to advance my learning of
          tricky javascript concepts + continue my journey learning rustlang ~

          I recently ordered some new switches for my keyboard and will be doing
          my first ever 'lubing' of said switches and stabilizers. Hoping I
          don't make a mess but looking forward to the supposed meditative
          effect of the whole process.
