        <p><b>Keyboard Layouts</b></p>
        <p>
          Alternate keyboard layouts to QWERTY have been developed over the
          years to break free from the traditional typewriter-based system.
          These layouts propose to reduce unnecessary finger movement as well as
          improve both typing speed and ergonomics. After suffering a moderate
          concussion from unfortunate cabinet door placement (weâ€™ve all been
          there), I felt perhaps it was a good time to learn something new.

          I started off with <em>Colemak</em>. It was created by Shai Coleman in
          2006, and was designed with QWERTY as a base, retaining the positions
          of most non-alphabetic characters and shortcuts. This is commonly
          cited as making it easier to adopt than Dvorak for most. It places the
          most frequently used letters of English on the home row. <br />
          I found that base Colemak placed many important keys in the middle two
          columns. This seems to be a pretty common complaint with this layout.
          Having to repeatedly move your index fingers around can be extremely
          taxing.

          <em>Workman</em> was developed by programmer OJ Bucao in 2010. I had
          heard a lot of praise about how it solved many of the uneven finger
          distribution issues within colemak. It employs an opinionated approach
          to finger movement, based on the idea that the index finger preferes
          to curl inwards rather than outwards. More info on this philosophy
